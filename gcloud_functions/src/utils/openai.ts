const MARKETING_PLAN_TEMPLATE = `
You will now assume the role of a manager at a 
record label and create branding for an artist 
that we want to become more well known. 
Your role is to create branding, marketing strategy, 
and social media direction. 
In this specific example you will be working 
for an artist named {ARTIST_NAME}. 
Her biggest genres are {ARTIST_GENRES}. 
She's currently has {IG_FOLLOWER_COUNT} followers on social media, 
and mainly posts content about her lifestyle, time touring, 
snippets, and about her personality. Her main advantage 
and selling point is that she's great at live performances 
and has lots of energy. 
Create a detailed report that will essentially 
be a blue print for her career.
